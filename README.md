# ðŸ§­ Compose Navigation Samples

A simple **Jetpack Compose** app demonstrating **two different navigation approaches**:

1. **Android Navigation Compose** â€” official Jetpack library  
2. **[Compose Destinations by Rafael Costa](https://github.com/raamcosta/compose-destinations)** â€” a type-safe, annotation-based navigation library for Compose

This project helps you understand and compare both approaches through a minimal 3-screen flow.
